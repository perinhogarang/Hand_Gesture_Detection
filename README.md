# Hand_Gesture_Detection by Eng. Peirnho Garang

Hand Gesture Recognition with OpenCV – Odd or Even Number Detection
🚀 Welcome to my Hand Gesture Recognition project! 🤖

This project uses OpenCV and Python to create a fun and interactive system that detects hand gestures based on the rules of Hand Cricket and determines whether the shown number is odd or even.

🖐 How It Works
Real-Time Gesture Detection:

The system uses OpenCV to capture and process real-time video from your webcam.

It recognizes hand gestures based on the number of fingers shown (inspired by Hand Cricket rules).

Odd or Even Detection:

Once the gesture is recognized, the system determines if the number is odd or even.

The result is displayed on the screen in real-time.

🛠 Tech Stack
OpenCV: For real-time image processing and gesture recognition.

Python: For logic and integration.

MediaPipe: For hand tracking and gesture detection (optional, if used).

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

MediaPipe (pip install mediapipe) (if used)
